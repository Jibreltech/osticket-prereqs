We’ll begin by setting up a virtual machine (VM) in the Microsoft Azure portal. A virtual machine provides an isolated environment that behaves like a real computer but runs in the cloud. This approach is safer and more practical than using your personal computer, since it allows you to test, configure, and experiment without affecting your main system.<p>

</p>
<p>Next Connect to your Virtual Machine. To access your virtual machine, open the Microsoft Remote Desktop application on your computer. In the connection window, enter the public IP address assigned to your virtual machine. Once you’ve done that, the system will prompt you to provide your username and password. After entering your credentials, click Connect, and you’ll be logged into your virtual machine, ready to begin working.

</p>
<p>
Once you’ve connected to your virtual machine, the next step is to install and extract the osTicket-Installation-Files folder. Once you have done that move the osTicket-Installation-Files folder to your desktop, and it should appear similar to the example shown in the image above.
We’re installing this folder because it contains all of the required files and resources needed to set up osTicket in one convenient location. Keeping everything organized in a single folder will make the installation process smoother and easier to follow.</p>
